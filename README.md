# Heights Media Code Exercise
Thanks for applying to Heights Media! Below are some simple code exercises we'd like you to complete so we can evaluate your problem-solving tactics and general approach to engineering, specifically using javascript and coffeescript. Please fork this repository and push your solutions, and share the url with your contact at Heights Media.

## The Essay Questions

1. Please describe in a single paragraph the advantages and disadvantages of using CoffeeScript over Javascript.
2. What do you consider to be the biggest challenges of programming JS applications targeting mobile devices?
3. What are the most important things to consider when writing a media-heavy JS application for mobile web?

## The Code Problems

### Promises
Javascript programming can be terribly event heavy, and without careful consideration you can wind up with unreadable spaghetti code due to massive amounts of nesting. Promises are meant to assist with this problem. How would you rewrite the following javascript code sample using promises? https://github.com/lkrnac/jasstor/blob/master/lib/jasstorClbk.js

### Embedding
One of the most bizarrely complicates uses of Javascript in the advertising world involves embedding new HTML elements within an existing page. Depending on the stage of page load, this may require a different approach. Please provide an example of at least two different approaches and explain which situations you would use each in.

## Conclusion
Thanks for taking the time to go through our little code interview. Check out this video if you haven't seen it already, it's pretty funny: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
